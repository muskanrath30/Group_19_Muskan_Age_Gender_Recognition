This project is about Age or Gender Recognition by voice in Python. The part of the project uploaded in the github repository is Gender Recognition. 

The dataset for this project has been taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/primaryobjects/voicegender

The dataset contained no null values. All the features in the dataset were taken for training the datasets with Machine Learning models. 

The given problem is a classification problem. Hence the models used were: SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision Tree. 

The classification score for each of the models was found and a thorough comparison was done on the same. 

Then ROC curve and pie charts were drawn to furthermore analyze the performance and the accuracy of the predictions made by the model. 

At last, we could conclude that Random Forest is the most optimal source of the model.
